https://www.mdi.ac.in/programmes/advanced-business-analytics,"The importance of analytics for organizations originates from the massive amount of data being generated through various online platforms that the businesses are dealing with. Further, large amount of data caters to the consumer sentiments that can positively or negatively impact the sustainability of the firms. The bandwagon effect and the competitive environment has forced organizations to open analytics divisions without any training and guidance to the novice starters. To tackle these challenges, we propose a very robust and detailed program on advanced business analytics. Contrary to management beliefs, we propose that the standard datasets and models may be outdated and there is a need to transition to more complex and open-source programming platforms. This unique program will focus on advanced analytics tools for descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics solutions coupled with some real-world case studies.
 The key objectives of this course are as follows: 

To understand the fundamentals of different types of advanced business analytics solutions and their applications. 
To analyze the training, validation, and test datasets through various analytics and data mining tools. 
To apply the principles and learnings from advanced analytics to real life supply chain problems

The key objectives of this course are as follows: 
Functional analytics 
Descriptive analytics using statistical models 
Problem diagnosis and feedback 
Predictive analytics for prediction and classification 
Prescriptive analytics for optimization

https://www.mdi.ac.in/programmes/neuroscience-in-marketing-business,"Advances in the fields of neuroscience and neuroeconomics are re-defining and enhancing our understanding of how human beings make decisions in general and how consumers make decisions from a marketing perspective. Neuro based laboratory and field applications can generate more advanced insights on consumer behaviour, team member behaviour, and employee behavior that can add enhanced value to managers in their implemention of marketing plans. Current evidence suggests that using neuro tools to generate behavioral insights (the how and why of a behavior) can lead to predictions that are more accurate by 20-40% and actions that are more likely to elicit the desired behavior from the target customer or other relevant person.
Based on research and consulting in this field by the program coordinator and faculty who will teach on the programme, the programme will cover neuroscience and its applications in the area of consumer behaviour, pricing, packaging and marketing communications and other business areas.The programme is designed:
• To develop the participant's basic knowledge of how the human brain operates – what are some basic brain operating principles?
• To understand using the brain operating principles how we take decisions based around the themes of “thinking and feeling, conscious and unconscious;” how the brain receives stimuli, processes them and the responses that it generates.
• To learn about the appropriate use of neuro tools in the generation of consumer and human behaviour insights
• To apply these insights in the areas of pricing, marketing communications, packaging, product design, and employee behaviour. with the objective of producing behaviour change in the target audience

https://www.mdi.ac.in/programmes/pricing-for-profit,"Pricing is essential in driving business profits, but it is vastly underutilized to maximize firm profitability, gain market share, and enhance customer value. In a global survey of 1700 organizations, Bain & Company found that, although most companies reported pricing as their top priority, 85% stated there is significant room for improvement in pricing. Although pricing can be changed quickly and easily, businesses invest in growing sales, advertising, and reducing inefficiencies. Further, if managers know how to price anything right, it can directly impact the bottom line. For example, a 1% increase in realized prices can result in 11% profit improvement.
Pricing for Profit will alter the way you think about pricing. Instead of simply relying on simple pricing models, you will appreciate an in-depth understanding of pricing and how it impacts other stakeholders, including customers and competitors.

https://www.mdi.ac.in/programmes/advanced-competitive-strategy,"Why do some firms outperform others in the same business environment? This question lies at the heart of Competitive Strategy, which is essentially the study of why some companies succeed. In contrast, others fail to gain a competitive advantage over their rivals in the industry. The concepts and ideas often impact a manager’s approach to regain competitive advantage to add value to the organization. For example, some competitors decide their boundaries and co-exist, while others have rivalries to get business. New concepts are built around notions of complementarities and strategic fit. Overall, an advanced level of competitive strategy requires managers to have a ‘big-picture’ view of a company’s situation and decide upon courses of action that will help a company to act or win against rivals in the fiercely competitive marketplace. Globally, managers are operating in a dynamic, uncertain and ambiguous environment. Rising risks such as pollution, infectious disease, lockdown, and the act of war are creating many new problems for the organization. In addition, managers are facing issues related to ethics in strategic decision-making. The recent pandemic (COVID-19) forced companies to change their approach for sustainable competitive advantage. The environmental changes force managers to change their strategies - Strategic Risk Management, Strategic Change, and Business Transformation are often used to overcome these risks and issues. The decisions managers undertake to sustain a competitive advantage in the face of competition are important in changing environments. This course will discuss how managers should shape their strategies in the dynamic business environment and crises. The experience and learning from the cases and latest research will add to your knowledge in this MDP.

https://www.mdi.ac.in/programmes/operational-and-organizational-excellence,"The word excellence is widely used to denote superlative performance in any activity in which an individual or organization is engaged. In the context of organizations excellence may refer to some aspects of their activities or it may also be used for their overall performance. It is difficult to define organizational excellence because some of its elements are intangible which cannot be quantified or measured. Excellence must really be seen in terms of competition. The competition has been an integral part of evolution itself. It manifests itself in fights among males and females of the species in trying to win the best mates for procreation. In business, there has always been a competition among organizations to win customers and investors. Operational Excellence is a philosophy of leadership, teamwork and problem solving resulting in continuous improvement throughout the organization by focusing on the needs of the customer, empowering employees, and optimizing existing activities in the process. This operational excellence is derived from the implementation of Kaizen concept in corporations. In contrast to the usual emphasis on revolutionary, innovative change on an occasional basis, Kaizen looks for uninterrupted, ongoing incremental change. In other words, there is always room for improvement and continuously trying to become better. In practice, Kaizen can be implemented in corporations by improving every aspect of a business process in a step by step approach, while gradually developing employee skills through training education and increased involvement.

https://www.mdi.ac.in/programmes/validating-strategy-like-a-military-general,"This program focuses on a game-changing approach to strategy and planning that will keep businesses ahead of competitors. Developed by military and intelligence agencies, this planning approach is a revolutionary way to stress-test strategy, flush-out unseen threats, and missed opportunities, and execute more successfully in an increasingly uncertain world. This approach will help any company plan better, anticipate emerging competitors, and avoid potentially disastrous mistakes. Businesses might be using this planning approach to stress-test turnaround plans, to recognize their corporate structures, to vet investment targets, to formulate their pitches to investors, and to figure out how to find the upside in a slowing global economy.
The tools and techniques discussed in the program make critical and contrarian thinking part of the planning process, forcing companies to take a hard look at their assumptions, examine the ways in which plans could fail, and consider alternative explanations and perspectives. It will enable organizations to make smarter choices and turn disruptive events into opportunities.

https://www.mdi.ac.in/programmes/fraud-risk-management-governance-8212,"Over the years, the world has witnessed numerous corporate scandals and white-collar crime by people at the top. This has been a collaborative activity, rather than an individual effort, and is a serious, costly, and growing epidemic for business and government and in particular for shareholders, and therefore call for serious financial diligence - disrupting the silos of misconduct to foster real world change for stakeholders’ interests at large. In our modern-day-risk landscape, companies must navigate uncertainties in the internal and external environment. Though no company likes the possibility of bad actors committing fraud, external and internal risks of fraud remains a pressing-and costly-concern. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners’ (ACFE) 2020 Global Fraud Study, organisations lose an average of 5% of revenue to fraud each year. Fraud risk management, simply put, is the process of assessing fraud risks within your organization and then developing an anti-fraud program that stops any fraudulent activity before it happens. It involves identifying potential and inherent fraud risks and developing a program that works to detect and prevent suspected fraud, both internal and external to the business. Having a reputation for integrity is crucial to safeguarding market confidence and public trust. If there is no fraud risk management strategy in place, fraud has the potential to grow like a virus, destroying the health of businesses and causing greater and greater losses. The present program brings extensive real-world experience with fraud analytics capabilities to examine the ""financial hazards,"" how they inevitably result in financial and corporate blowups and what lessons we can draw from blowups such as those of Enron, WorldCom, Satyam Computers, Kingfisher Airlines, Lehman Brothers, and the recent IL&FS, and DHFL for understanding the health of the organisation in a more focused and targeted approach.• Fraud Risk Assessment - The Domino Effect!

https://www.mdi.ac.in/programmes/behavioural-economics-pricing-bep-with-case-studies-7357,"Economic theory tries to explain how a typical ‘rational’ economic agent ‘ought’ to behave. One of the critics of this paradigm is behavioral economics which attempts to explain and model how an economic agent actually behaves. In the process it wants to model people as ‘nice’ and also ‘people are stupid’ so there is a shift from how an agent ought to behave to how the agent is behaving. The type of questions that are raised are: is the utility maximizing rational consumer a good enough approximation of consumer behavior, or ‘expected utility’ a good enough approximation of decision making under uncertainty and in the process brings back psychology into economics. This is what economics has been invented for. This could have serious implications for pricing as well as viability of the organization.The programme aims to understand how the psychological insights in human behaviour helps in designing corporate and public policies towards pricing, saving and investment behaviour, finance, health and medical care, improving choice architecture, and climate change, and resist temptation etc. Look at things from longer term perspective and from collective perspective for a sustainable business, planet and people.

https://www.mdi.ac.in/programmes/supply-chain-analytics-for-resilient-operations,"After globalization, Indian organizations are striving very hard to sustain their competitiveness in the digital era. Post-Covid 19, supply chains are also facing a lot of disruptions. Supply chains should become resilient by digitizing their processes to overcome these disruptions. For digitization of processes, organizations are implementing emerging technologies such as big data analytics, artificial intelligence, blockchain technologies, the internet of things, etc. In this digitization process, organizations are facing many organizational and operational challenges. In the present context of a globalized market, the product life cycle has shortened due to the dynamic requirement of markets in terms of taste, durability, quality, flexibility, low price, etc. In the past, most organizations have tried to improve their individual operations for improving their individual performance by initiatives such as advanced manufacturing technologies applications, Just in time approach, lean manufacturing, quality management, etc. It has been observed that performance improvement in a particular organization of a value chain has saturated; therefore, it is urgently required to improve performance in terms of the complete value chain. Performance of whole value chain can be improved only after successful integration and coordination among different members of value chain by using emerging technologies. Nowadays, competition between individual organizations has been replaced by Competition among Supply Chains. The digitization of supply chains also plays a critical role in improving supply chains resilience.
In a global economy, to improve the competitiveness ranking of any country, minimization of waste in processes and efficient production systems are essential. It has been observed specifically in context of India that leakages in Public Distribution Systems, Waste in Food Sector, Losses in transportation sector, Lack of IT enabled systems, lack of world class product quality, processes inefficiencies, escalation of input resources cost; product rejections at buyer end, huge inventory stock, lack of process digitisation are major areas of concern. To tackle such challenges, each individual needs to be trained about applying emerging technologies and decision-making tools in supply chains. Therefore, knowledge and application of different decision making tools such as Multi criteria decision making tools, Linear programming, Decision tree, Descriptive and Predictive analytics is very important. For effective supply chain management in the digital age, accurate decision-making based on available data also plays an important role.This programme would assist participants

Great organizations are able to develop the capability to align themselves quickly with the internal and external changes that are brought in by the new compulsions. They keep evolving and redesigning themselves for an appropriate response to the changing business scenario. Towards this goal, they focus themselves on building a dynamic structure, engaging culture, organizational leadership brand and the requisite people capabilities. Research reveals that managing change becomes more efficacious if employees’ concerns are addressed along with business issues. The redesigned agendas of some leading organizations even envisage “people first and customer second” focus.

https://www.mdi.ac.in/programmes/operational-and-organizational-excellence-3514,"The word excellence is widely used to denote superlative performance in any activity in which an individual or organization is engaged. In the context of organizations excellence may refer to some aspects of their activities or it may also be used for their overall performance. It is difficult to define organizational excellence because some of its elements are intangible which cannot be quantified or measured. Excellence must really be seen in terms of competition. The competition has been an integral part of evolution itself. It manifests itself in fights among males and females of the species in trying to win the best mates for procreation. In business, there has always been a competition among organizations to win customers and investors. Operational Excellence is a philosophy of leadership, teamwork and problem solving resulting in continuous improvement throughout the organization by focusing on the needs of the customer, empowering employees, and optimizing existing activities in the process. This operational excellence is derived from the implementation of Kaizen concept in corporations. In contrast to the usual emphasis on revolutionary, innovative change on an occasional basis, Kaizen looks for uninterrupted, ongoing incremental change. In other words, there is always room for improvement and continuously trying to become better.

https://www.mdi.ac.in/programmes/effective-communication-for-engaging-teams-for-improved-productivity-4394,"Managers are often confronted with the challenge of leading an increasingly heterogeneous team that is diverse along the lines of gender, generation, physical ability, appearance and ethnicity among others. Research suggests that differences can lead to lesser engagement and more conflicts in teams, and reduce organizational commitment. Yet, there is evidence that increased engagement bolsters learning potential of teams and hence helps in unleashing creativity and innovation. Some organizations are trying to frame engagement as a process to be leveraged with the assumption that talented and creative employees come from diverse backgrounds. This approach helps facilitate producing the requisite people behaviors, attitudes, and mental models that are necessitated by the demand of high performance work systems, so as to realize the company’s business strategies.
Engaging teams is more than simply acknowledging differences in people. Hence it’s required to support planned and positive engaging practices in sync with the organizational culture to capitalize on its benefits.• Understanding team diversity: gender, generation and others- challenges and opportunities

https://www.mdi.ac.in/programmes/sdg-implementation-strategies-with-analytics,"The pattern of economic growth is gradually pushing the world towards a corner, from where a return might not be possible. Intergenerational equity is not being maintained due to this nature of growth, and this has economic, social, and ecological ramifications. To restore balance in the world, a new set of sustainable practices needed to be implemented. Thus, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) came into existence.
Sustainable development is the target of every nation around the world, and the policymakers are looking for solutions to implement the SDGs. As the individual goals of the 17 SDGs are linked with each other, it needs a holistic approach to implement the SDGs in any nation. Therefore, it is always hard to find out the beginning point. This beginning point should be designed in such a way, so that almost all the SDGs can be covered in a single move. This might require the modeling of the sustainability framework with the economic, social, and ecological aspects.
So far, the implementation of the SDGs has not been very successful on a global scale. There are several reasons behind this. According to the United Nations, data gaps are a major issue in implementing SDGs. It undermines the true picture of SDG implementation of a nation. Hence, a systematic implementation of SDGs needs to take care of these data-oriented challenges. Moreover, effective diffusion of learning from the entire implementation process is required.
This program will allow the participants to understand the data gaps pertaining to SDG objectives, as well as how to bridge these data gaps, so that the best practices can be replicated. The participants will also understand the roadblocks in the way of implementation, and how to develop a data-driven approach to tackle those obstacles. These roadblocks are faced during two phases, i.e. (a) during the implementation phase of SDGs, and (b) during the replication phase of the SDGs. Therefore, knowing the data gaps and developing solutions to bridge those gaps will make the participants have an end-to-end perspective about the implementation of SDG objectives.• Understand different aspects of SDGs
